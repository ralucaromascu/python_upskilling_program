# Formatted cart

This week, we're going to play with f-strings, which in Python 3.6 provided an alternative syntax to the `str.format` method. I want to model a shopping cart, into which I can put items. I can then ask the cart to show me a short version of its contents, or a long version.

Let's say that I decide to go shopping. I'm going to create a cart, with an instance of Cart:
    
```python
cart = Cart()
```

I'll then add a number of items to my cart. Each item is represented by an Item object, which has four attributes: `quantity`, `measure`, `name`, and `price` per measure. Thus, if we're buying 1.5 kg of tomatoes at 5 currency units per kg, we'd say:
    
```python
cart.add(Item(1.5, 'kg', 'tomatoes', 5))
```

We can then add a bunch of such items to our shopping cart:

```python
cart.add(Item(2, 'kg', 'cucumbers', 4))
cart.add(Item(1, 'tube', 'toothpaste',2))
cart.add(Item(1, 'box', 'tissues',4))
```

We can then ask our cart for two different types of reports, using `str.format`. If we pass our object the `short` keyword after the colon in the format string, we'll just get an alphabetized list of the items:

```python
print(f"Your cart contains: {cart:short}")
```

In our case, that'll print:

```
Your cart contains: cucumbers, tissues, tomatoes, toothpaste
```

But we can also ask for a `long` report using the format string, as follows:
     
```python
print(f"Your cart:\n{cart:long}")
```

The results:

```
Your cart:
            2 kg    cucumbers  @ $4.0...$8.0
            1 box   tissues    @ $4.0...$4.0
          1.5 kg    tomatoes   @ $5.0...$7.5
            1 tube  toothpaste @ $2.0...$2.0
```

You can, of course, adjust the formatting so that it's a bit nicer than this. But the idea is to have a table with the four attributes — plus a final column containing the cost of that item.

You'll need to create the `Item` and `Cart` classes, with particular emphasis on ensuring it works with `str.format`.

Some useful information on `str.format` (whose formatting codes are used in f-strings) is [here](http://pyformat.info/).

The code needs to pass the tests in [ex17_formatted_cart_test.py](ex17_formatted_cart_test.py) file.
