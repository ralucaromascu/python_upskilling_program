# Serial mix

This week, we're going to experiment a bit with mixins.

If you're familiar with objects, then you know that each class inherits from another class — except for `object`, which is at the root of the inheritance tree (in Python, this means that object's `__bases__` attribute is an empty tuple, rather than containing one or more classes). You can inherit from more than one class, if you want, although I would argue that this often makes things worse, rather than better.

Mixins take advantage of multiple inheritance, in that you inherit from multiple classes. However, the point of a mixin class is to add functionality — either by defining a needed method that wasn't set in the main parent class, or to override a method in the main parent class. That is, you inherit from a main class, but then also inherit from a mixin class in order to change the behavior. A mixin class will only define methods, and not define any data (attributes) of its own.

This week, I want you to define a class, Serializable, that defines two methods, `dump` and `load`. If a class inherits from our `Serializable` class, then you can invoke `dump` and `load` on objects of that type, and it'll know how to use the `pickle` module from the standard Python library to save itself to disk, and load itself from disk. A filename needs to be passed to `dump` and `load`, so that the methods know with which file to work.

I should thus be able to do the following:

```python
class Book(Serializable):
    def __init__(self, title, author, price):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.price = price

b = Book('Practice Makes Python', 'Reuven Lerner', 39)
b.dump('book.data')      # book is now stored on disk, in pickle format

b2 = Book('blah title, 'blah author', 100)
b2.load('book.data')     # title, author, and price now reflect disk file
```

The thing is, maybe we don't want to store the book info in `pickle` format. Maybe we want to use CSV, or JSON, or XML. I want you to define a class for each of these formats, so that I can do the following:

```python
class Book(CSVMixin, Serializable):
    def __init__(self, title, author, price):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.price = price

b = Book('Practice Makes Python', 'Reuven Lerner', 39)
b.dump('book.csv')      # book is now stored on disk, in CSV format

b2 = Book('blah title', 'blah author', 100)
b2.load('book.csv')     # title, author, and price now reflect disk file
```

You'll similarly create `JSONMixin` and `XMLMixin`.

You can find the solution in [ex33_serial_mix_solved.py](ex33_serial_mix_solved.py), but try creating your own before looking at this one.
