## tr

Unix contains all sorts of great little utilities. Some of these utilities, I've found, are excellent examples of things we can do easily in Python.

This week, we'll look at the `tr` utility that Unix provides. In its most basic form, `tr` allows us to translate from one set of characters to another. For example, if I want every occurrency of "z" in a file to be turned into an "s", then I can do the following:
```shell
$ echo 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog' | tr z s
the quick brown fox jumps over the lasy dog
```

Notice that `tr` expects to get its input from stdin.  We can modify more than one letter; `tr` only works on individual letters, so we can do the following:

```shell
$ echo 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog' | tr sz zs
the quick brown fox jumpz over the lasy dog
```

This turns every occurrence of 'z' into an 's', and vice versa.  Note that this also shows that the translation occurs once per letter.

The same letter can appear in the destination mulitple times:

```shell
$ echo 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog' | tr aeiou yyyyy
thy qyyck brywn fyx jymps yvyr thy lyzy dyg
```

This translates every lowercase vowel (a, e, i, o, or u) into a "y" character.

If the destination string (i.e., the second one) is shorter than the source, then the final letter in the destination covers the rest. For example:

```shell
$ echo 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog' | tr aeiou xy
thy qyyck brywn fyx jymps yvyr thy lxzy dyg
```

Or:

```shell
$ echo 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog' | tr aeiou xyz
thy qzzck brzwn fzx jzmps zvyr thy lxzy dzg
```

For this week's exercise, I want you to implement `tr` as a function that takes two strings, and returns a function that performs the translation on a string. In other words, we should be able to do the following:

```python
vowels_to_y = tr('aeiou', 'y')
print(vowels_to_y('the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'))
```

and we should see:

```
thy qyyck brywn fyx jymps yvyr thy lxzy dyg
```
Note that we're not going to try to do the more complex parts of `tr`, such as ranges of characters, complements, and the like. And of course, it's unfair to use the `str.translate` method for this to work!

The code needs to pass the tests in [ex36_tr_test.py](ex36_tr_test.py) file.
