# Math practice

My son needed some practice using positive and negative numbers. I told him that I'd prepare 100 exercises for him to do, and that they would be ready in about five minutes. He gave me that "You can't possibly be serious" face, but when I presented him with 100 questions just five minutes later, he was somewhere between surprised and horrified.

On question 10 or so, he said that he would like to have an answer key, to know if he got it right.

So I went back to my computer, and hammered out a program that read through the file that I had created, and came up with the answer.

For this week's exercise, I want you to replicate what I did, more or less.

First, you will want to create a text file containing 100 (or a smaller number, if you're less cruel than I am) exercises. Each exercise will involve addition (+) and subtraction (-) of four randomly chosen positive and negative integers. Let's say that the integers should range from -40 to 40, but it shouldn't be too hard to adjust that range as necessary.

Here is what the first five lines of the file might look like:

```
[  1]   19 - (   1) - (   4) + (  28) = ______
[  2]  -18 + (   8) - (  16) - (   2) = ______
[  3]   -8 + (  17) - (  15) + ( -29) = ______
[  4]  -31 - ( -12) - (  -5) + ( -26) = ______
[  5]  -15 - (  12) - (  14) - (  31) = ______
```

Notice that I've tried to keep everything aligned, and that I put parentheses around all numbers, since he's new to negative numbers and can get confused by the whole `2 - -1` thing.

Second, I want you to write a program that reads through the lines of this text file and calculates the solution for each of these lines. The output from this program should look like:

```
[  1]   19 - (   1) - (   4) + (  28) = 42
[  2]  -18 + (   8) - (  16) - (   2) = -28
[  3]   -8 + (  17) - (  15) + ( -29) = -35
[  4]  -31 - ( -12) - (  -5) + ( -26) = -40
[  5]  -15 - (  12) - (  14) - (  31) = -72
```

The code needs to pass the tests in [ex8_math_practice_test.py](ex8_math_practice_test.py) file.
